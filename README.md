## About

Unity 3D Game for Android devices. 
Built in Unity 2021f

Status of project: unfinished!

### The main goal of the project

The main goal of this project is make a **game architecture** based on a **state machine** and try out some of the programming patterns in practice. Also in this project for the first time I tried to use **object pooling**, the **factory pattern** and **dependency injection without the help of any external DI frameworks.**
